                <p>"I have often said that when it comes to jQuery, half the battle is just being familiar 
                with the types of things it is capable of doing. Having a good foundation can easily help 
                you bridge the gap between 'This is going to be complicated' and 'I can do that with 
                jQuery!' Like any good recipe book, this book includes ready-to-use code samples that 
                demonstrate basic to advanced techniques. In addition to the major areas noted in the book 
                title, there are references on how to customize the jQuery UI features to meet your 
                needs and bonus sections about creating and using plugins. I also really appreciate 
                the authors' insights regarding performance issues and best practices. Lastly, 
                speaking as someone with no previous jQuery Mobile experience, this book provides 
                solid examples to get you up and running fast. Overall, this book will help to greatly 
                expand the skills in your jQuery arsenal."

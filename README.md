                          GENERAL JAVA PROJECTS
These are some of the java projects which I have done for my courses and some of them are my personal projects.All of them work without errors.I have also used a few to tutor an undergrad class.So its pretty easy to understand.
Though they are not upto production standards but its good for beginners at java.
Fell free to edit or download.
Happy Coding!!!!
Cheers!!!!!
